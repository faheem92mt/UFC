			<h1 class="contro">Controversial Win at UFC 247! Is Jones still the GOAT?</h1>

	          The challenger came out sharp in the first two rounds, clearly giving Jones problems and landing clean punches. Reyes even appeared to score a knockdown in round one after catching Jones with a straight left, but it may have been a slip given that the strike landed on Jones’s body.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Round two was a better one for the champion, but the bout continued to be fought at Reyes’s pace and there was no sign of Jones’s wrestling or his expert clinch work. Jones had success with his trademark oblique kicks, which may have paid dividends for him in the later rounds. Still, Reyes was constantly pressing forward while striking effectively—occasionally forcing Jones to literally run away—and made a strong case to be up 20-18 heading into the third period.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Round three, Jones and Reyes are both scoring now, neither able to pull away on the cards (at a glance, anyway). There’s visible damage accumulating as Reyes’s nose is bloodied and swelling around Jones’s eyes needs tending to between rounds. Jones goes for his first takedown attempt in round three and Reyes defends against it well. Despite possibly being down on the scorecards, the champion looks to be the fresher fighter after a hotly-contested 15 minutes.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          The championship rounds are easier to score and not because of any inherent deference to Jones, the incumbent titleholder. It’s in the last two frames that Jones is finally able to take Reyes down, which may have played a part in the judges’ decision even though he wasn’t able to initiate any significant offense off of the takedowns and Reyes recovered quickly. However, Reyes does not seem to be landing as consistently as he did in the early stages of the fight and Jones has reason to believe he’s earned another decision win.
